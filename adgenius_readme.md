## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Psychology-First Interface** - Every UI element reinforces psychological principles
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Advanced features emerge as users demonstrate readiness
3. **Contextual Personalization** - Interface adapts to user role and experience level
4. **Anticipatory Design** - System predicts needs based on behavioral patterns

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Neural Black Backgrounds** (lch(8% 0 0)) for focus and premium feel
- **Strategic Gold Accents** (lch(70% 75 45)) for conversion psychology
- **Perceptual Color Science** using LCH color space for consistent visual weight

## 🧪 Research Foundation

### Photography Principles Integration
- **Composition Rules**: Rule of thirds, golden ratio, leading lines
- **Technical Specifications**: Realistic camera settings (f/2.8, 1/125s, ISO 400)
- **Lighting Setups**: Three-point lighting, color temperature optimization
- **Color Theory**: Complementary, analogous, and monochromatic schemes

### Psychology Framework
- **Behavioral Triggers**: Social proof, scarcity, authority, reciprocity
- **Cognitive Load Theory**: Information architecture optimized for decision-making
- **Conversion Psychology**: Tested principles from Ogilvy, Bernbach, and modern research
